# DETAIL_PM_README.md

This document describes the manual operations of each password manager.

We have identified that the manual operations required for PMs can be divided into the following four categories at a high level, which reduces the uniqueness of each PM's operation:

1) PM account registration or vault creation. Separately-installed PMs require an initial account registration or vault creation, which involves setting a master password. This process typically only needs to be done once.
2) Inputting/Importing Tested Data: To evaluate the autofill functionality, it is necessary to manually input or import the test data into each PM. This process is generally different in each PM but can be done by following the user interface instructions. For browser-based PMs, this step needs to be repeated for each new browser instance initiated by Selenium (without any local profile by default). We have included sample data in the `Sample Data\` directory to facilitate this process. For separately-installed PMs, this process needs to be done only once after logging into the PM.
3) Logging into PMs and unlocking PMs. For separately-installed PMs, logging into the PM or unlocking the password vault is necessary before each experiment. For PMs having desktop applications like 1Password and KeePassXC, synchronization between the desktop application and the browser extension is also required (like `Enpass` in our given instance). Based on our experiments, we have provided the necessary time (in seconds) for a proficient tester to log into the PM under the `require_login_time` field in the `Code\config\pm_config.py` file. This operation needs to be conducted each time we conduct the experiment.
4) Triggering autofill manually. A few PMs require manual intervention to trigger the autofill functionality, such as clicking the PMs' icon on the browser toolbar or clicking the right-click menu. Our code simulates this process by right-clicking the webpage and reserving time for users to complete these actions to trigger the autofill functionality. This behavior is configured in the `whether_right_click` field of the `Code\config\pm_config.py` file. When this field is set to True, the manual operations after the right-click are needed.

As the inputting/importing data and the account registration processes follow the PM's user interface, we have not included them in the documentation. Instead, we focus on the steps needed when the PM account has already been created and data has been set up.

> We run each experiment using the following command in the command line.
> 
> '''cmd
> python autopm.py --pm_name pm_name --form_type form_type --is_input is_input --is_local is_local
> '''
>
> - pm_name: the name of the password manager 
> - form_type: the type of the test form type
> - is_input: whether the concealment technique is applied on the \<input\> element itself (rather than its ancestor element)
>- is_local: whether Selenium will start the local browser instance with a local profile

## LastPass (Extension ID: hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd)

> This PM provides autofill functionality for all three web forms.

1. **Login Process**: When Selenium starts a Chrome browser instance with the LastPass extension, testers need to manually click the LastPass icon in the browser address bar to trigger the login form from the extension. Testers must input their email address and master password to unlock LastPass.
2. **Risk-Based Authentication**: Occasionally, LastPass may trigger a risk-based authentication, sending an email verification to the tester: `To Continue: Check your inbox for an email from LastPass: [masked email address] or Review your login info and try again.` This email verification process needs to be done first, and then testers need to re-input the master password to log into the LastPass extension.
3. **Experiment Execution**: Once logged into LastPass, no further manual operations are needed to run experiments on our test cases' three web forms.

## Avira (Extension ID: caljgklbbfbcjjanaijlacgncafpegll)

> This PM provides autofill functionality only for login forms.

1. **Login Process**: When Selenium starts a Chrome browser instance with the Avira extension, testers need to manually click the extension icon in the address bar. This will navigate the browser to the Avira password manager homepage. Testers must click the `Sign in` button at the top of the webpage and input their email address and password for authentication. After this, testers may also need to enter the master password for the Avira password manager.
2. **Initialization Delay**: After entering credentials, testers may need to wait approximately 10 seconds for the Avira PM to complete the initialization process.
3. **Experiment Execution**: Avira only provides autofill functionality for login forms and automatically fills these forms upon page loading. Once logged in, no further manual operations are required to run our experiments.

## Norton (Extension ID: admmjipmmciaobhojoghlmleefbicajg)

> This PM provides autofill functionality for all three web forms.

1. **Unlock Desktop Application**: Testers are recommended to first unlock the 1Password desktop application before starting any experiments.
2. **Browser Extension and Desktop Application Synchronization**: When Selenium starts a Chrome browser instance with the 1Password extension, the browser will navigate to the 1Password extension welcome page. Testers should wait for synchronization between the desktop application and the browser extension, and pin the 1Password extension to the browser toolbar if needed.
3. **Experiment Execution**: No further manual operations are required to run our experiments after synchronization. Note that for credit card forms, under specific concealment techniques, our tool may throw exceptions because the PM does not recognize forms with concealed credit card number fields as valid credit card forms.

## Bitwarden (Extension ID: nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb)

> This PM provides autofill functionality for all three web forms.

1. **Login Process**: When Selenium starts a Chrome browser instance with the Bitwarden extension, testers need to click the extension icon in the address bar manually. The Bitwarden login form will appear, where testers must input their email address and master password in a two-step authentication form, choosing the `master password` login method. Sometimes, Bitwarden may trigger a CAPTCHA, which testers need to solve to proceed.
2. **Autofill for Login Forms**: For login forms, Bitwarden will automatically autofill the email address and password upon page loading. No further manual operations are required for login forms during the experiment.
3. **Autofill for Personal Information and Credit Card Forms**: For personal information and credit card forms, Bitwarden requires manual intervention. Testers need to right-click the webpage, and then testers choose `Bitwarden` -> `Auto-fill identity` or `Auto-fill card` to fill these forms. To accommodate this, we have used Selenium to simulate the right-click action and reserved time for testers to complete the autofill process manually.

## Kaspersky (Extension ID: dhnkblpjbkfklfloegejegedcafpliaa)

> This PM provides autofill functionality for all three web forms.

## Google Chrome

> This PM provides autofill functionality for all three web forms.

For detailed instructions on using the built-in-browser password manager in Chrome browser, please refer to the `README.md` file in the same directory.

## Microsoft Edge

> This PM provides autofill functionality for all three web forms.

The main process is the same as that of the Chrome browser. If the tester does not use the local profile, they must add sample data into the built-in-browser PM. However, after this addition process, there is no further manual operation during the experiment.

## Safari

> This PM provides autofill functionality for all three web forms.

Safari does not support loading user profiles with pre-entered sample data or allowing subsequent manual interactions for testing purposes. Due to this limitation, experiments involving Safari are conducted manually on macOS Monterey 12.7.4.

Specifically, we manually visit all the test websites, trigger the autofill functionality of the Safari browser to fill in the web forms. Then, we utilize JavaScript `document.getElementById(#id).value` command in the DevTools to retrive the vaule in the hidden fields. Finally, we can determine whether Safari will autofill data into hidden fields.

## Mozilla Firefox

> This PM provides autofill functionality for all three web forms.

The main process is the same as that of the Chrome browser. If the tester does not use the local profile, they need to add sample data into the built-in-browser PM. However, after this addition process, there is no further manual operation during the experiment. Note that Firefox by default does not allow autofilling personal information in locations except US. Thus, we recommend that testers could set the country of the personal information as `US`.

## Opera

> This PM provides autofill functionality for all three web forms.

The main process is the same as that of the Chrome browser. If the tester does not use the local profile, they need to add sample data into the built-in-browser PM. However, after this addition process, there is no further manual operation during the experiment.

## Brave 

> This PM provides autofill functionality for all three web forms.

The main process is the same as that of the Chrome browser. If the tester does not use the local profile, they need to add sample data into the built-in-browser PM. However, after this addition process, there is no further manual operation during the experiment.
